# Fast and Modular Exponentiation

This project implements three different exponentiation methods:
- *Normal Exponentiation (O(n))*: Simple iterative approach.
- *Binary Exponentiation (O(log n))*: Efficient exponentiation using bitwise operations.
- *Modular Exponentiation (O(log n))*: Optimized method to prevent overflow.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using:
   
   g++ exponentiation.cpp -o exponentiation
   
2. Run the program:
   
   ./exponentiation
   
3. Enter *base, exponent, and modulus* (for modular exponentiation).
